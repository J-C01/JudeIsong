## About Me

I trained as a teacher at the University of Ibadan and completed a Diploma in Computer Science at the University of Calabar.  
I transitioned into tech as an IT Support professional and upskilled into web development.  

Alongside my tech work, I’ve volunteered extensively as an online community manager — first for **Ingressive For Good** (managing two learner groups) and later for **La Plage Meta Verse** (as a student, then volunteer managing four learner groups).  

I currently work with **Greening Youth Foundation** (a US-based NGO with a sister organisation in Nigeria) and I’m enrolled in **Cisco Learn’s Ethical Hacking program**.  

My strengths are:  
- Translating technical concepts into simple learning steps  
- Solving user problems quickly and effectively  
- Building communities that help learners succeed
